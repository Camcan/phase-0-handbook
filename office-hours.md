# Office Hours

Office hours are a time that you can ask questions and bring issues to a Phase 0 coach. Some examples of office hours issues are: looking over code, working through parts of a challenge, problems setting up git, or getting your development environment on track.

Office hours are typically between 9-10 and 2-3, but variations do occur between coaches and cohorts. During this time you can find your coach on the slack channel ready to recieve your stypi's and asnwer your questions. 

Outside of office hours, we recommend reaching out to your fellow cohort and alumni on the [slack channels](slack.md) and or using the [treehouse forum](https://teamtreehouse.com/forum).
