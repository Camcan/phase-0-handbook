**Q: Do I need to sign up for an orientation session?**<br>

**Q: Do I have a student email address?** <br>
**A:** All students will have a firstname.lastname@devacademy.ac.nz. This is not like a usual email address however, and can not be used to send emails from. Any emails sent to the email will automatically arrive in your primary personal email account. 

**Q: Do I have to pay for TeamTreehouse and Pluralsight?** <br>
**A:** No, while you are in phase-0, EDA will cover the costs. If you however want to continue using treehouse after you graduate, we can arrange a graduate package for you at a discounted rate. Pluralsight is free to all students for 1 year.
