# Office Hours

Office hours are a time that you can ask questions and bring issues to a Phase 0 coach. Some examples of office hours issues are: looking over code, working through parts of a challenge, problems setting up git, or getting your development environment on track.

Office hours vary depending on the coach and cohort - Your coach will advise you of when they are. 

Outside of office hours, we recommend reaching out to your fellow cohort and alumni on the [slack channels](slack.md) and or using the [treehouse forum](https://teamtreehouse.com/forum).
