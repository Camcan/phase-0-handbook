# Welcome to Enspiral Dev Academy!
*Last Revised 1/04/2015*

You are in your pre-Phase 0 prep period. Before you can start Phase 0, you will need to complete a few administrative tasks and personal preparation. Please go through each of these sections and complete each task. You should be well acquainted with our program by the end and will be ready to start Phase 0 by your start date.

It is necessary to complete the [End of Prep Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-MW9w5sHtyWZCoFFyDoIqFU8xgDClGIQug2ufACy0-4/viewform) after you have completed all the tasks. The sooner you do this, the sooner we are able to provide you access to material and cirriculum. 

**Please note:** During the week prior to phase-0 you will begin to receive a number of important invitations to our Dev Academy systems. Please be on the lookout for these messages.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or feedback for the Phase 0 team, please contact us at <phase0@devacademy.co.nz>.

# Before Entering Phase 0

#### Introduction
Please take a moment to read the [students guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5aB0OHeInzgODlnR2hQZXk3c0U/view?usp=sharing) if you haven't done so already.   
  
Phase 0 is an integral Phase of Enspiral Dev Academy (EDA); it is not optional. We cover the fundamentals you will need to be successful in the intensive portion of EDA.

You may be thinking that Phase 0 will not be intense because it is remote, but it is. Please refrain from scheduling any vacations, trips, etc. during Phase 0 unless you expect to do the work during that time and have reliable internet access. There are weekly deadlines for challenges and other tasks you will be required to do each week.

The amount of time it takes to complete each week varies greatly from person to person. On average people spend 20-30 hours a week, however some are able to complete in much less while others need to spend longer on the material. If you are unable to complete the material, you might be requested to repeat the phase. 

<!-- #### Choose your stream 
You will need to know which stream you are wanting to be in (Ruby or C# .NET) before phase-0 begins. If you don't know yet which stream you will be in, please check out the [stream requirements](/stream-requirements.md) -->

# Phase 0 Prerequisites

#### 1. Create Accounts
You will need each of these accounts for Phase 0. The general rule of thumb is to **use your first name as part of your username wherever possible** and include a photo of yourself (i.e. not your cat or bike). This helps us, the Dev Academy community of staff, teachers, coaches and alumni to better support and help you. 

- [Google](https://accounts.google.com/Signup)<br> It is necessary to either link your personal email address to google or to use a gmail account. Please do not use a work email address. 

- [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/)<br> You will get a Socrates account when you start Phase 0, and it will pull your picture from Gravatar. Please make sure your picture is of your face so we can get as much practice with your name as possible. 

- [Github](https://github.com/)<br> You will start using github on day-1, so please create an account with **your first name as part of your github user name.** This will be where you keep all of your code from EDA and becomes your technical resume when you apply for jobs.

- [Stypi](http://stypi.com)<br> Stypi helps you share code with others. Click on the gear icon in the right hand corner. Create an account using your google-linked/gmail email address and use your **firstnamelastname** as your user name. You will use Stypi in the weeks to come when pairing with people or when seeking support from coaches. 

 
#### 2. Onboarding 
**These links won't work immediately** as you will need to be invited to join them - you will receive these invites during the week before phase-0 begins. Please make sure they are complete by the Friday before the start date and be sure to check your social messaging and spam folders. 

- [Slack](/slack.md)<br> Our Slack channel is where you communications and support requests take place. Quite often coaches and alumni will be on the channel and able to unstick you if you get stuck. We recommend using either the desktop app or have the web app signed on when you are working through the Phase 0 material.  

- [Google Groups / Google drive](https://drive.google.com/a/enspiral.com/folderview?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgeWZoQm9VaWJQeWc&usp=sharing)
This is essentially a mailing list for your cohort (e.g. Kakapo-2015@devacademy.co.nz) and will give you access to learning materials that are stored on the student drive. You can only access this once you have completed the end of prep survey. 

- [TeamTreehouse](treehouse.md)
Much of the material to prepare you for bootcamp is delivered through Team Treehouse. EDA will provide you with a student treehouse account which you can use during the duration of phase-0 and bootcamp. You should recieve an invite shortly.

#### 3. Orientation 
We will host a virtual orientation class the morning and evening of your phase-0 start date. Please schedule it into your calendars and be available to participate in EITHER one of the sessions (i.e. not both). Orientation will take about 45 minutes and will be a short intro to Dev Academy tools and challenge submission.  

#### 4. Watch
The following videos introduce some key concepts of the Phase 0 experience.
You will be expected to be familiar with each of these prior to starting Phase 0.

- Engineering Empathy: [EQ: Emotional Intelligence](https://vimeo.com/99779530) 15 min
- Giving and Receiving [Feedback](https://vimeo.com/99780302) 27 min
- Checking in before [Pairing](https://vimeo.com/76662569) 5 min

#### 5. Complete the End of Prep Survey
Complete the [End of Prep Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-MW9w5sHtyWZCoFFyDoIqFU8xgDClGIQug2ufACy0-4/viewform). Within the form there is an optional question regarding your learning style (see personal preperation below). If you have the time we recommend completing step 6 before starting the survey.

## Optional but highly recommended:

#### 6. Personal Preparation 

You are about to embark on a new learning experience. You will be challenged in new ways that will excite and frustrate you (often at the same time). It's important to prepare yourself for success by recognizing how you learn best and what you enjoy when you are in a learning environment. Recognizing what you need will help you be able to express what you need when learning and make your experience at Dev Academy more fulfilling. You will be spending a significant amount of time working with others, so it's important to practice explaining your ideas to others. **keep track of your results**

- Understand the difference between <a href="http://examinedexistence.com/carol-dweck-on-fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset/" target="_blank">growth and fixed mindset</a>.
- Identify your
<a href="http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire" target="_blank">VARK learning style</a>.
- Understand your <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="_blank">thinking style</a> and what you enjoy or find challenging when learning (**optional**)

#### 7. Typing and shortcuts
It's important to be able to type at a decent clip in this new career you've embarked on! That said, it's not the end of the world if you struggle with typing, just take some time to practice, practice, practice!

- Take a baseline [test](http://www.typingtest.com/index.html) to see how fast you currently type.
- To learn the basics in touch typing and to improve your speeds, try either [typingstudy](http://www.typingstudy.com/lesson/1/part/1) or [typingclub](http://www.typingclub.com/typing-qwerty-en.html).
- If you are already an accomplished touch typist, try [typing.io](https://typing.io/) to practice typing code, which has a ton of strange symbols.
- For shortcuts, try [shortcutfoo](shortcutfoo.com). You'll want to know about some of the awesome sublime text shortcuts.
You need to be able to:
 - Type at least 40 words per minute
 - Use common shortcuts in Sublime  

#### 7. Read [This Handbook](readme.md)  
The detailed document outlines the Phase 0 Program in great depth, so please take time to read it and get comfortable with Phase 0 and Dev Academy!   

#### 8. Update your browser
It's very important that you're using the latest version of your web browser. For Phase 0, we recommend working with [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/).</br>
