# Choose your stream  

You will need to know which stream you are wanting to be in (Ruby or C# .NET) before phase-0 begins. Here is some advice regarding your equipment and setup, but please note 

- **we are unable to provide support for anything that deviates from industry standard (Ruby on Mac OSX or Linux, and C# .NET on windows.)**   
  
Ruby Students  
  
Ruby belongs to the open-source world and is generally geared towards a Unix development environment, such as Linux and Mac OS.
If you’re currently a Windows user, we highly recommend you consider installing a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu, which can be installed in a separate partition of your hard-drive (allowing you to select between Windows and Ubuntu at startup) or in a Virtual Machine application such as VirtualBox which will allow you to run a Ubuntu environment directly from Windows.
Using a virtual machine is fine for Phase 0 but you will definitely want to consider setting your Linux up as a separate partition OS for the bootcamp phases and your future development career.  
   
   
C# .NET Students  
  
You will be focusing on the .NET framework, which is a Microsoft owned product and is therefore aimed at being used within a Microsoft Windows environment.
If you’re working on a Mac, you can setup a separate partition with Bootcamp which will then allow you to boot natively into a Windows environment on your Mac.
